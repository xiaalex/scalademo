## Scala sample code
    
This project includes some Java and Scala implementations for some algorithms.

### Java implementation

#### Binary Tree

Binary tree pre-order traversal
Binary tree in-order traversal
Binary tree post-order traversal
Binary search tree validation

#### Edit Distance

Implementation of Edit Distance Algorithms

#### Isomorphic String

First form: For example,"foo" and "app" are isomorphic because there is mapping of f-a, o-p and "bar" "foo" are not
Second form:  For isomorphic sets, cat vs act, same set but diff structure

#### Max Substring

The max substring of unique chars of a string

#### Word Break

Given a string and a dictionary, break string into words

### Scala implementation

#### Group by code example

Group by key and return a map

#### Reverse string example

To reverse string at step k, for example:

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
    
becomes

    3 2 1 6 5 4 9 8 7 10

#### String Break

Given a dictionary of words, break a string into words
